# MayaCharm
Maya integration with run and debug configurations for Maya. MayaCharm lets you execute the current document or 
arbitrary code as if it was in Maya from PyCharm. For users of the professional version of PyCharm it will also setup 
and connected the pydev debugger to Maya as well.

For those just wanting a installable *.jar file of the plugin, you can get the lastest stable one from here.
